                    <p>We use Google AdSense Advertising on our website.</p>
                    <p>Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google’s use of the DART
                        cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on previous visits to our site and other sites
                        on the Internet. Users may opt-out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google Ad and
                        Content Network privacy policy.<br/>We have implemented the following:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>We, along with third-party vendors such as Google use first-party cookies (such as the Google
                        Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party
                        identifiers together to compile data regarding user interactions with ad impressions and other

                    <p><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong></p>
                    <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years
                        old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal
                        Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which
                        spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy
                        and safety online.</p>
                    <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>
                    <p>Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13?
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong></p>
                    <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States
                        and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data
                        protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how
                        they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect
                        personal information.</p>
                    <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive
                        action, should a data breach occur:</p>
                    <p>We will notify you via email within 7 business days</p>
                    <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right
                        to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere
                        to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against
                        data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to
                        investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
                    <p><strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong></p>
                    <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for
                        commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them,
                        and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
                    <p><strong>We collect your email address in order to:</strong></p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>

                        <li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li>
